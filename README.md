# steg-of-the-dump-scala
Scala terminal version of https://github.com/holloway/steg-of-the-dump

Project inspired by the awesome "Twitter Secret Messages" webapp.

I wanted to do my own version, in Scala, for fun, runnable in the command line :)

For now, I only did the "encoding" part (the original source code, in JS, was a bit obscure, it took a while to re-write it)

It generates a Lorem Ipsum, and hides your "secret" message in the generated Lorem Ipsum

You can check your encoded message here: http://holloway.co.nz/steg/#

Have fun ;)
